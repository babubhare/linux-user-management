2. run ./setpermissions.sh to apply permissions to all the other scripts\n

OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION\n
If you are a novice linux user using this script you can also\n

2. Disable password and root login\n

  #edit the file\n
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n

  #set the following\n

  PermitRootLogin no\n
  PubkeyAuthentication yes\n
  PasswordAuthentication no\n

  #reload config\n
  service ssh restart\n

3. Create a non root account and put it in a group that can sudo (this script will do that for you)\n
4. Allow that group to sudo\n

  #edit the sudoers file\n
  visudo\n

  #add the following under members who might gain root privileges\n

  %group-name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n

This should allow the user whose public key you added to ssh into the server without being required to present a password\n
